# javascript-test
This repository allows me to list some of the tests I did in javascript 

## test_4_osm_circle
This project has been created to test the integration of a map with OpenStreetMap (OSM) cause of restrictions linked to Google Maps integration and API usages. To do it so, I used Leaflet which is a free and opensource Javascript library which allow to integrate maps (for all map providers (google maps, OSM...)). I added a circle on the map to designate an aera on which a fictive professional can go arround a city.
